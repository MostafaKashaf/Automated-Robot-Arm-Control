# Automated-Robot-Arm-Control

### This project demonstrates the development of a robotic arm control system using the LEGO Mindstorms EV3 platform and MATLAB. The main objective was to implement precise pick-and-place operations using techniques from mechatronics, including:

- Inverse Kinematics for converting Cartesian coordinates into joint angles.
- PID Control Loops to ensure smooth and accurate arm movement.
- Sensor integration, including touch and ultrasonic sensors, for environmental awareness and motion boundaries.

### The robot was programmed to move between predefined stations, detect object heights, and perform actions like picking, placing, and returning to a home position. The system was tuned through manual PID adjustment and tested under different operational scenarios.
